Generally, for all customers, by advertising, the Average Purchase Rate for test group is 0.041 higher than control group, which results in 64687.50 increase in the expected revenue. This increase shows that it makes sense to do some advertising for Game-Fun in the future since the revenue is greatly increased.\n",

For non-gamers, the average purchase rate changes very subtly, which means that this group of people may not be elastic to our advertisements, and they can not contribute a lot to the revenue increase.

    "After reading this paper, the biggest point that resonated with me is that 'These methods(propensity score methods) are intended to eliminate bias, but are not intended to increase precision.' Before I read this paper, when it comes to propensity score methods, all I can think about is that it is a method for us to eliminate bias so that the precision can be increased, but the author mentioned that the elimination of bias and the increase in precision are actually separated two things. Precision refers to the accuracy and consistency of the estimated effect size. It is affected by the sample size and the variance of the outcome variable. For propensity score methods, it can only eliminate bias when the assignment mechanism is truly unconfounded given the observed covariates X, but still, only randomization can elinimate bias due to all covariates. The author recommended blocking and matching on paticular covariates as techniques of increasing precision. Blocking refers to the process of stratifying the sample into subgroups based on a particular covariate or set of covariates that are strongly associated with the treatment assignment and the outcome. By doing this, the treatment and control groups within each stratum will be more similar, which reduces the variance of the outcome variable and increases precision. Matching involves selecting controls for each treated subject that have similar propensity scores. This creates pairs of treated and control subjects that are similar in terms of observed covariates, which again reduces the variance of the outcome variable and increases precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, propensity score methods can eliminate bias due to confounding variables, but precision can only be increased by using other techniques such as blocking and matching. However, it is important to keep in mind that the precision of the estimate is also affected by other factors such as the sample size and the variance of the outcome variable."
